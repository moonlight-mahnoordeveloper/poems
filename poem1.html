<p>In morning light, the world awakes anew,<br>
With dreams like dew on grass, so fresh and clear,<br>
The sky adorned in shades of dawn’s soft hue,<br>
Life’s canvas waits, its path to reappear </p>
<br><br>
<p>As midday sun climbs high, we chase our goals,<br>
With every step, the moments weave and blend,<br>
Our laughter rings, our hopes and fears unfold,<br>
In vibrant hues, the day begins to end </p>
<br><br>
<p>As twilight casts its gentle, fading glow,<br>
Reflections dance on waves of time and space,<br>
We find our peace in memories that flow,<br>
And cherish every curve upon life’s face.</p>
<br><br>
<p>With stars above, our thoughts begin to rest,<br>
In dreams we journey far beyond the night,<br>
Each day a gift, each moment truly blessed,<br>
In life’s grand dance, we find our hearts’ delight.</p>
